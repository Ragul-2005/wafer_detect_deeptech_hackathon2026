## 📌 Overview

  <p align="justify">This repository presents an end-to-end Edge-AI pipeline for semiconductor wafer defect classification using SEM images, designed to support automated, low-latency inspection in smart manufacturing environments ⚙️. Semiconductor fabrication generates massive volumes of high-resolution inspection data across multiple process stages, where manual inspection and centralized analysis pipelines often struggle with scalability, latency, and infrastructure overhead 📉.</p>

  <p align="justify">The objective of this project is to demonstrate how a lightweight deep learning model can accurately classify multiple wafer defect categories while remaining suitable for edge deployment 🚀. The work focuses on custom dataset engineering 🧪, defect reclassification 🧩, transfer learning using MobileNetV2 🧠, quantitative evaluation on both held-out test data and completely unseen samples 📊, and export of the trained model to ONNX for edge compatibility 🔧. The resulting model is validated using ONNX Runtime and is aligned for future deployment on Edge-AI platforms such as NXP eIQ ⚡.</p>
